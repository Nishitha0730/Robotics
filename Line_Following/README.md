# Line Following with e-puck in Webots

This project demonstrates two different approaches to implementing a line-following robot using the e-puck robot in the Webots simulation environment. The project includes two scenarios: one using basic line-following with two IR sensors, and another using a PID controller with five IR sensors for more precise line tracking.

## Features

### Scenario 1: Basic Line Following
- Utilizes two IR sensors to detect the black line.
- Implements simple conditional logic to adjust the robot's direction based on sensor inputs.
- Ideal for understanding the fundamentals of line-following robots.

### Scenario 2: PID Line Following
- Employs five IR sensors for enhanced line detection and tracking.
- Uses a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to ensure smooth and accurate movement along the line.
- Demonstrates advanced line-following techniques suitable for more challenging environments.


## Future Work
- Extend the PID controller for dashed line following.
- Implement dynamic obstacle avoidance while line-following.
